security: # configuration for the `safety check` command
  # ignore-cvss-severity-below: 0 # A severity number between 0 and 10. Some helpful reference points: 9=ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL severity. 7=ignore all vulnerabilities except CRITICAL
  # ignore-cvss-unknown-severity: False # True or False. We recommend you set this to False.
  # ignore-vulnerabilities: # Here you can list multiple specific vulnerabilities you want to ignore (optionally for a time period)
  #     # We recommend making use of the optional `reason` and `expires` keys for each vulnerability that you ignore.
  #     25853: # Example vulnerability ID
  #         reason: we do not use the vulnerable function # optional, for internal note purposes to communicate with your team. This reason will be reported in the Safety reports
  #         expires: '2022-10-21' # datetime string - date this ignore will expire, best practice to use this variable
  # continue-on-vulnerability-error: False # Suppress non-zero exit codes when vulnerabilities are found. Enable this in pipelines and CI/CD processes if you want to pass builds that have vulnerabilities
